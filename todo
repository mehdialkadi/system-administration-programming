Write a script called “todo” that maintains your todo tasks. Each todo task has a unique identifier,
a title, a description, a location, a due date and time, and a completion marker. The script should
prompt the user to enter all latter information. The title and the due date are required, and the other
fields are optional.
The todo script should be able to perform the following actions:
• Create a task.
• Update a task.
• Delete a task.
• Show all information about a task.
• List tasks of a given day in two output sections: completed and uncompleted.
• Search for a task by title.
When “todo” is invoked without arguments, it displays completed and uncompleted tasks of the
current day.
Make sure to control the validity of user inputs as much as possible. Error messages should be
redirected to standard error.
